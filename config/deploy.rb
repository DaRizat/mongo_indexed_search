# Set access to git repo...
# On default deployment, Capistrano executes git clone|checkout commands on
# prod server (deploying to).
# However, its a security concern to setup our prod server to access git repo (a private key
# needs to be put on the prod server for passwordless access).
# So instead we only allow dev machine to access git repo via ssh key.
# So during Capistrano deployment, latest code is checked out from repo to dev/local box,
# compressed, sent via scp to the prod server and then uncompressed.
# Takes tad longer to deploy an update but increased security makes up for the slight delay.
# Setting up Capistrano to use this deployment strategy is as simple as adding deploy_via :copy or :remote_cache
